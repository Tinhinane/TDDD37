* By having the 'Reservation' attribute in the 'Flight' relation, you
can have only one reservation per flight. It should be possible to have
multiple reservations on each flight.

* By having the 'PassportNumber' attribute in the 'Reservation'
relation, you can have only one passenger per reservation. It should be
possible to have multiple passengers on a reservation.

When you modify your design to address these issues, also make sure that
it will be possible to add passengers to a reservation _before_ the
reservation has been paid for, that is, before there are ticket numbers
for each of the passengers in the reservation.
